## Welcome to Li Hongmin's Homepage

I am a PhD student of Computer Science at Mathematical Modeling & Algorithms Laboratory in University of Tsukuba. My research interests include Spectral clustering, Machine learning and related fields.

Currently, I am supported by JST under Support for Pioneering Research Initiated by the Next Generation.
